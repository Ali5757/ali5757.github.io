Third year PhD student at the university of Ottawa, supervised by Simon Henry, my research interests are logic/category theory (categorical logic). Most of my work concerns studying categorical axiomatisation of ultraproducts, and their applications across various areas of mathematics. Iâ€™m interested in understanding the expressive power of topological categories (in the broadest sense possible i.e any category of objects carrying some sort of topological structure), and how they can always store information related topological theories (example Grothendieck toposes), as well as their role in modelling higher categorical structures. Other research interests includes model theory, analysis and their connections (continuous logic). For future plans, I would like to see how much category theory formalism can be pushed to understand other areas of mathematics, and other related fields like physics (using tensor categories), and computer science (connections between categorical logic and type theory).
