collection: 'publications'
venue: 'preprint'
excerpt: 'We explore a new class of ultrcategories, those of complete metric structures, which can be better understood in the framework of continuous model theory, introddcing the notion of bundles of models, and showing it corresponds to a certain class of left ultrafunctors, this notion reduces to already known notions, like Banach bundles and Hilbert bundles.'
